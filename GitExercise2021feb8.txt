exercises (with just the command line):
    1. create an empty file -> touch empty.file
    2. rename that file -> mv empty.file renamed.test
    3. create a new folder -> mkdir NewFolder/ or mkdir /c/NewFolder/
    4. move the file into the folder -> mv renamed.test NewFolder/empty.file
    5. delete the folder including its contents -> rm -r NewFolder
    6. look up "echo" and use it to output some text. -> 

         Wcs -C T S@Wcs MINGW64 /c/JaMESwEIGHT-Code (main)
         $ touch Store.Log

         Wcs -C T S@Wcs MINGW64 /c/JaMESwEIGHT-Code (main)
         $ echo "Test" > Store.Log                         // OverWrite >

         Wcs -C T S@Wcs MINGW64 /c/JaMESwEIGHT-Code (main)
         $ cat Store.Log
         Test

         Wcs -C T S@Wcs MINGW64 /c/JaMESwEIGHT-Code (main)
         $ echo "Good" >> Store.Log                        // Append >>

         Wcs -C T S@Wcs MINGW64 /c/JaMESwEIGHT-Code (main)
         $ cat Store.Log
         Test

7. look up "which" and use it to find where dotnet is installed. -> which -a dotnet

8. look up "grep" and use it to search a file for some text. -> findstr "cd" Gitcommands.txt
