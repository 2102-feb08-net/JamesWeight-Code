Engineering is a discipline.

To build and rebuild from parts and components for an integration of a systematic purpose.

Dr. Steven Ybarra said in my public speaking class, "If you write the beginning and then write the end, now you can write how to get there..."

In Engineering, if you design the intended result and create a suitable foundation to construct with, now you can craft and mold all the inter-connecting pieces together into a practical mechanism for the purpose to be achieved.

Technologies change and evolve.  Some become Legacy.  Some become antiquated...

Some are still utilized but advised as a deprecation.

Programming is this concept of good results stem from good inputs and an established throughput to achieve said results.

In a system, there are standards and collaborations between its members.

Knowing how each member functions with one another to create team-work and good synergy with one another.

The Principles of Engineering have resounded as implementations to all technologies.

Learning how is more important than just knowing what of any technology.

Adaptability is the fundamental principle of Polymorphism and Abstraction.

Inherentcy gives the ability to build and rebuild for scalability and efficiency.

Encapsulation allows components in a system to evolve and enhance its usability and applications.

Having a sound plan in the beginning can save from mistakes and incompatible methods.

As a fellow Engineer, what is your plan of action to find a solution to alleviate a problem?
